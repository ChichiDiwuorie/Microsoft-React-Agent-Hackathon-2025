1. Microsoft 365 Agent SDK Setup
Goal: Integrate backend API access to Power BI or Power Automate for dataset querying based on user input from Copilot.
Issue: Requires proper 365 Agent SDK configuration within the Azure account to enable seamless interaction.
2. Power BI Alerts with Pro License
Goal: Automate alerts based on dataset conditions and push notifications to Teams via Power Automate.
Issue: Power BI Pro license alone is insufficient as alerts require a Microsoft Fabric license, limiting automation capabilities.
3. Dynamic Query Creation in Power Automate
Goal: Generate dynamic Power BI DAX queries using the "Run a Prompt" action in Power Automate, referencing dataset structure.
Issue: The action requires manual approval, making it unsuitable for autonomous task execution.
4. Copilot Agent Action Setup for Power BI/Power Automate
Goal: Configure Copilot Agent to trigger Power Automate flows for querying datasets based on user input.
Issue: Implementation is blocked due to the challenges in setting up Microsoft 365 SDK (Issue #1) and the manual approval constraint in Power Automate (Issue #3).
